# Dynamic array in C++

This project is an implementation of a dynamic array (analogous to `std::vector`) in C++. 
A dynamic array allows efficient memory management and provides convenient methods for working with elements.

# Dynamic array features

My dynamic array supports the following functions:

1. **Creation**:  
   You can create an empty dynamic array with an initial length of 0 and a capacity of 8.

2. **Adding elements**:  
   A dynamic array allows you to add values to the end and to the beginning of the array.

3. **Deleting elements**:
You can delete the last or first element of the array.

4. **Changing and reading values**:
Accessing array elements allows you to change values by index and read them.

5. **Insertion and deletion by index**:
The array supports the ability to insert an element at a given index and delete an element by index.

6. **Getting information about the array**:
You can get information about the current capacity and length of the array.

7. **Copying and merging arrays**:  
   It is possible to copy arrays, as well as combine two arrays into a new one.

8. **Checking for emptiness and clearing**:
You can check if the array is empty and, if necessary, remove all elements from it.

9. **Iterating through elements**:
Access to array elements is implemented for their iteration and output.

10. **Sorting**:
The array supports sorting of elements.

11. **Element Search**:
You can find the index of the first occurrence of a certain value in the array.

12. **Array reversal**:
The array can be reversed by changing the order of the elements.

13. **Duplicate Removal**:
The array supports the removal of duplicate elements, leaving only unique values.

14. **Capacity change**:
You can reduce the capacity of the array to its current size or increase it to the specified value.

15. **Filling the array**:
The array can be filled with a specified value for a certain number of elements.

16. **Deleting a range of elements**:
You can delete elements from the array in the specified index range.

17. **Data exchange with another array**:  
    The array supports content exchange with another array of the same type.

18. **Iterators**:
Implemented iterators for convenient iteration of array elements.
